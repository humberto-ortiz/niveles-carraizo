# Plot water level in Carraizo

A simple Flask + pygal app to plot the water levels in Carraizo reservoir.

Scrapes the water level from [AAA](http://www.acueductospr.com/niveles/)
using a cron job and plots the data with pygal.

Used the [openshift flask quickstart app](https://github.com/ryanj/flask-base)
to get started.
