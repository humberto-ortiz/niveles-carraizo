# Plot water level in Carraizo

A simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
 + [pygal](http://pygal.org/)
  app to plot the water levels in Carraizo reservoir.
  See it [live](http://flask-alephazul.rhcloud.com).

Scrapes the water level from [AAA](http://www.acueductospr.com/niveles/)
using a cron job and plots the data with pygal.

Used the [openshift flask quickstart app](https://github.com/ryanj/flask-base)
to get started.
